# GoSh!
A Shell made in Go, for fun  
## Features
- Display Working Directory
- History file wich you can browse for past commands
- Some colors
- Config file
I'm planning to add more features later (like syntax hilighting, etc...).  
I'm also learning Go by doing this project.  
You can expect breaking changes (or code), the problem has a workaround in the commit message.  
If not, the issue will be fixed soon (in case of a typo for example)  

## Installation
You can grab the binaries for your system and architecture, or build it yourself
To build it, clone the repository, cd into it and run go
