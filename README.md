# GoSH
A Shell made in Go, for fun  
## Features
At the moment, there isn't much features.  
I'm planning to add more features later (like syntax hilighting, a history file and a RC file, etc...).  
I'm also learning Go by doing this project.  
You can expect breaking changes (or code), the problem has a workaround in the commit message.  
If not, the issue will be fixed soon (in case of a typo for example)
